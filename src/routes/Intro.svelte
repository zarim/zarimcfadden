        I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at North Carolina State University studying systems of oppression in computer science research. My research is focused on creating a tool that helps researchers critically engage with systems of oppression in their research. I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Spelman College in 2020.

        In my free time, I'm training for a marathon, traveling the world, and reading. I am also a self-published author of a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/18-Things-Ive-Learned-Years/dp/0578485303" target="_blank">18 Things I've Learned in 18 Years</a>.
